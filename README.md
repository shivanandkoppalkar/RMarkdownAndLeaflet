# R Markdown and Leaflet: Interactive Map of the U.S. States 

<ul>
  <li> I used the R package "leaflet" to create an interactive web map of the U.S. states with information about their population  </li>
  <li> Each marker on the map represents the corresponding U.S. state flag and is placed at the approximate geographic center of each state. Alaska and Hawaii are placed just off the West Coast for convenience. (The data for the longitude and latitude of the center of each state is taken from the "state.center" list which is part of the "state" data sets from the "datasets" R package.) </li>
 
 <li> Click on a marker to see some information about each state. (The data about the population of each state is taken from the 2010 census and can be found, for example, in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population)) </li>
 
 <li> Hover over the map to see the highlighted boundary of each state and the name of the state. </li>
</ul>
